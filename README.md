# Maze
Sorting through arrays of hashes and spaces, I was able to use jpanel to generate a maze than can swap between a 3D and a 2D view

## Programing

I parsed this image as a string and converted it into a 2D array. I was then able to sort through each value and generate a wall, hallway, or the finish
